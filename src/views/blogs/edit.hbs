                    name="">Stretching is essential whether you are injured or have a tight muscle. It improves circulation and prevents injuries. Some people skip stretching in favor of cardio or hitting the weight room, but you should make time for it. Even a short stretch will help. Stretching also releases endorphins, a hormone that decreases pain perception. It is similar to a runner's high. Stretching is great for your mental and physical health, and it is a simple way to incorporate movement into your daily routine. While stretching can help ease muscle pain, it is essential to see a physical therapist if you feel it is affecting your daily activities. Physical therapists or even a professional stretching studio in Dubai can prescribe an exercise program for you that will help you get the most out of your activities. A physical therapist can also give you tips on how to perform stretches properly.</textarea>
