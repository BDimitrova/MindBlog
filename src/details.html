                <p>Stretching is essential whether you are injured or have a tight muscle. It improves
                    circulation
                    and prevents injuries. Some people skip stretching in favor of cardio or hitting the weight
                    room, but you should make time for it. Even a short stretch will help. Stretching also
                    releases
                    endorphins, a hormone that decreases pain perception. It is similar to a runner's high.
                    Stretching is great for your mental and physical health, and it is a simple way to
                    incorporate
                    movement into your daily routine. While stretching can help ease muscle pain, it is
                    essential to
                    see a physical therapist if you feel it is affecting your daily activities. Physical
                    therapists
                    or even a professional stretching studio in Dubai can prescribe an exercise program for you
                    that
                    will help you get the most out of your activities. A physical therapist can also give you
                    tips
                    on how to perform stretches properly.</p>
